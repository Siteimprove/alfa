/**
 * The rule tree is a data structure used for storing the rules that match each
 * element when computing cascade for a document.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Rules are stored in order from most to least precedence (according to cascade
 * sorting order); rules lower in the tree have therefore higher precedence than
 * rules higher in the tree. Each element gets a pointer to the highest
 * precedence rule it matched and can then follow pointers up the rule tree to
 * locate rules of decreasing precedence that the element also matches. This
 * allows elements that share matched rules to also share a path in the rule tree.
 *
 * As an example, consider elements `A = <div class="foo" href="A">`  and
 * `B = <div class="foo bar">`. Element A matches rules `div`, `.foo` and
 * `.foo[href]` whereas element B matches rules `div`, `.foo` and `.bar`. The
 * na√Øve approach to associating these matched rules with elements
 * would be to associate an array of `[".foo[href]", ".foo", "div"]` with
 * element A and an array of `[".bar", ".foo", "div"]` with element B. With the
 * rule tree, we instead start by inserting the matched rules for element A into
 * the tree:
 *
 *  "div"
 *  +-- ".foo"
 *      +-- ".foo[href]"    <- A
 *
 * We then associate rule `".foo[href]"` with element A and insert the matched
 * rules for element B into the tree:
 *
 *  "div"
 *  +-- ".foo"
 *      +-- ".foo[href]"    <- A
 *      +-- ".bar"          <- B
 *
 * We then associate the rule `".bar"` with element B, and we're done. Notice how
 * the tree branches at rule `".foo"`, allowing the two elements to share the
 * path in the rule tree that they have in common. This approach is conceptually
 * similar to associating arrays of matched rules with elements with the
 * difference being that we use linked lists instead of arrays, allowing us to
 * share parts of the list between elements. This allows for a much more memory
 * efficient way of associating matched rules with elements, in particular for
 * rules that match most elements, such as the universal selector or `html` and
 * `body`.
 *
 * Note that the resulting rule tree depends greatly on the order in which
 * rules are inserted, which must then be by increasing precedence. The `.foo`
 * and `.bar` selectors are not directly comparable, the example above assumes
 * that the `.bar` rule came later in the style sheet order and therefore wins
 * the cascade sort by "Order of Appearance". This information is not available
 * for the rule tree which relies on rules being fed to it in increasing
 * precedence for each element. If `.bar` came before `.foo`, the resulting tree
 * would be:
 *
 * "div"
 * +-- ".foo"
 *     +-- ".foo[href]"   <- A
 * +-- ".bar"
 *     +-- ".foo"         <- B
 *
 * {@link http://doc.servo.org/style/rule_tree/struct.RuleTree.html}
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * The rules tree is actually a forest of nodes since many elements do not share
 * any matched selector. We do not artificially root it as it would add little
 * value, there is no natural root, and creating a fake root would actually
 * make processing the tree harder (as we would need to handle that fake node).
 * As a consequence, when inserting new rules in the tree, we may start a
 * completely new tree in that forest. This means that rules may be inserted
 * without a parent, and adding a single rule must be a static method of the
 * Node class, rater than an instance method.
