/**
 * {@link https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-5/}
 *
 * @remarks
 * The cascade associates to each element a node into a rule tree.
 * A single rule tree is built for each document or shadow root. The cascade
 * lazily fills it upon need and caches the associated node for each element.
 *
 * Upon creating a cascade, the full rule tree is built for the empty context
 * in order to leverage the ancestor filter during tree traversal. This assumes
 * that we will often query style of elements in an empty context (the default)
 * and thus benefit from pre-building it for all elements.
 *
 * For specific contexts, we only add the nodes in the rule tree as needed. We
 * assume that we mostly query only a few elements in a specific context, and
 * that the cost of rebuilding a full cascade would be too expensive.
 *
 * The cascade automatically includes the user agent style sheet.
