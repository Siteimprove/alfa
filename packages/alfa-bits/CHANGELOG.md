- **Fixed:** The publish flow was updated to a new version. ([`a2f19cf9a6c7c72b8bf085597e4f1a95ac3e4eb2`](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/commit/a2f19cf9a6c7c72b8bf085597e4f1a95ac3e4eb2))

  Some 0.87.\* versions were generating uninstallable package. This should be fixed now.

### Minor Changes

- **Breaking:** TS resolution has been changed to `Node16`, target to `es2022`. ([#1636](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1636))

- **Breaking:** Alfa is now distributed as ESM rather than CJS modules; projects using it must be ESM or use dynamic `import()`. ([#1636](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1636))

  ⚠️ This is the last of a series of changes on the internal structure and build process of distributed packages that was started with v0.85.0.

## 0.85.1

## 0.85.0

### Minor Changes

- **Breaking:** The .js files are now built in the `dist` folder rather than in `src`. ([#1628](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1628))

  ⚠️ This is the first of a series of changes on the internal structure and build process of distributed packages. It is probably better to not use this version and wait until more of these internal changes have been done to jump directly to the final result. We are internally releasing these changes for validation purpose only.

  This should not impact consumers, the `package.json` files should be set correctly to consume these files.
