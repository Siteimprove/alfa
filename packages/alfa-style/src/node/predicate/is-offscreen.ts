/**
 * @remarks
 * We can't really detect if content is moved off-screen, due to the lack of
 * layout system.
 * Instead, we inspect a handful of properties that affect positioning. If their
 * value is "large enough", we consider this as an indication that the content
 * is actually off-screen.
 * Since pages are mostly vertical scrolling, and most of the languages we look
 * at are left-to-right, this is mostly accurate when content is moved to the
 * left. Content moved to the right may actually create horizontal scrolling.
 * Content moved to the top may still be on screen if the normal position would
 * be low enough on the page. We assume that the presence of a large negative
 * value is indication of the intention to move the content off-screen, and
 * that proper care has been taken to actually make it invisible. Aka we
 * consider that using "top: -9999px" to voluntarily move something from the
 * bottom of a long page to its top is enough madness that nobody does itâ€¦
 *
 * Content moved to the bottom simply creates scrolling on vertical pages and is
 * not considered here.
