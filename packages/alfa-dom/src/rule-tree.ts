/**
 * The rule tree is a data structure used for storing the rules that match each
 * element when computing cascade for a document. Rules are stored in order
 * from most to least specific; rules lower in the tree are therefore more
 * specific than rules higher in the tree. Each element gets a pointer to the
 * most specific rule it matched and can then follow pointers up the rule tree
 * to locate decreasingly specific rules that the element also matches. This
 * allows elements that share matched rules to also share a path in the rule
 * tree.
 *
 * As an example, consider elements A and B. Element A matches rules `div`,
 * `.foo` and `.foo[href]` whereas element B matches rules `div`, `.foo` and
 * `.bar`. The na√Øve approach to associating these matched rules with elements
 * would be to associate an array of `[".foo[href]", ".foo", "div"]` with
 * element A and an array of `[".foo", "div"]` with element B. With the rule
 * tree, we instead start by inserting the matched rules for element A into the
 * tree:
 *
 *  "div"
 *  +-- ".foo"
 *      +-- ".foo[href]"
 *
 * We then associate rule `".foo[href]"` with element A and go ahead and insert
 * the matched rules for element B into the tree:
 *
 *  "div"
 *  +-- ".foo"
 *      +-- ".foo[href]"
 *      +-- ".bar"
 *
 * We then associate the rule `".bar"` with element B and we're done. Notice how
 * the tree branches at rule `".foo"`, allowing the two elements to share the
 * path in the rule tree that they have in common. This approach is conceptually
 * similar to associating arrays of matched rules with elements with the
 * difference being that we use linked lists instead of arrays, allowing us to
 * share parts of the list between elements. This allows for a much more memory
 * efficient way of associating matched rules with elements, in particular for
 * rules that match most elements, such as the universal selector or `html` and
 * `body`.
