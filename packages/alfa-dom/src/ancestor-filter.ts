/**
 * The ancestor filter is a data structure used for optimising selector matching
 * in the case of descendant selectors. When traversing down through the DOM
 * tree during selector matching, the ancestor filter stores information about
 * the ancestor elements that are found up the path from the element that is
 * currently being visited. Given an element and a descendant selector, we can
 * therefore quickly determine if the selector might match an ancestor of the
 * current element.
 *
 * The information stored about elements includes their ID, classes, and type
 * which are what the majority of selectors make use of. A bucket exists for
 * each of these and whenever an element is added to the filter, its associated
 * ID, classes, and type are added to the three buckets. The buckets also keep
 * count of how many elements in the current path match a given ID, class, or
 * type, in order to evict these from the filter when the last element with a
 * given ID, class, or type is removed from the filter.
 *
 * For example, consider the following tree:
 *
 * section#content
 * +-- blockquote
 * +-- p.highlight
 *     +-- b
 *
 * If we assume that we're currently visiting the `<b>` element, the ancestor
 * ancestor filter would contain the `section` and `p` types, the `#content` ID,
 * and the `.highlight` class. Given a selector `main b`, we can therefore
 * reject that the selector would match `<b>` as the ancestor filter does not
 * contain an entry for the type `main`.
 *
 * NB: None of the operations of the ancestor filter are idempontent to avoid
 * keeping track of more information than strictly necessary. This is however
 * not a problem when ancestor filters are used during top-down traversal of the
 * DOM, in which case an element is only ever visited once. If used elsewhere
 * care must however be taken when adding and removing elements; elements must
 * only ever be added and removed once, and an element must not be removed
 * before being added.
 *
