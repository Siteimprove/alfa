# @siteimprove/alfa-dom

## 0.69.0

### Minor Changes

- **Added:** Tree `Node`, and DOM `Node` can now have an `externalId` (`string`) and some `extraData` (`any`). ([#1498](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1498))

  These are intended for callers that need to record some extra data during audits and retrieve it afterward. Especially, the `externalId` is intended for callers who already have an identifier for nodes and do not want to lose it during audits, nor maintain a map between these identifiers and Alfa nodes.

  Alfa is guaranteed to never interact with the `extraData` in any way; except that it will be typed as `any`, so any type guard or assertions must be re-applied afterward.

  Alfa may, in the future, decide that `Node` with the same `externalId` can be identified in some way, e.g., because they represent two versions of the same object that were turned into two different Alfa object. This can for example happen when two copies of the same page in different states (e.g., different tab opened) are audited; this creates two Alfa `Document`, but the external caller may have the extra knowledge that some of the nodes should be identified.

  It is up to the callers to ensure that the `externalId` are unique, since they are meant to carry knowledge that Alfa cannot infer.

  The `externalId`, if any, is included in the serialisation of nodes. The `extraData` is never included because Alfa does not ensure it is serializable (it may contain circular references, â€¦)

  `extraData` can only be provided when building DOM nodes with the `#of` methods, or the `h.*` functions. `externalId` for `Element` can also be provided by a key with the same name in the JSX syntax.

## 0.68.0

### Minor Changes

- **Breaking:** `Element#of` now requires the device used when scraping a page in order to store a box. ([#1474](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1474))

  This ensures that the boxes of the elements will be stored with and only be accessible for the same device instance. If no device is provided, no box is stored with the element.

- **Added:** `Document#toJSON` now optionally accepts serialization options containing device. ([#1474](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1474))

  The options will be passed down to all children of the document and used by `Element` to serialize the box corresponding to the device.

## 0.67.0

## 0.65.1

## 0.65.0

### Minor Changes

- **Added:** Support for optional `box` everywhere when constructing an `Element`. ([#1440](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1440))

  Boxes are expected to be the result of `getBoundingClientRect`, i.e. contain adding and border.

  It is up to the caller to ensure that the boxes were generated on the same `Device` that is used for audits. Alfa does not (and cannot) verify this.

  Alfa assumes that the boxes where generated with an empty `Context`. It is up to the caller to ensure that this is the case.

- **Removed:** Many pieces of code are no longer exported. These were mostly internal exports that are no longer used in other files and should not impact intended usage of the packages. ([#1437](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1437))

- **Breaking:** Renamed public property `rectangle` to `box` which was overlooked in the last version ([#1440](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1440))

- **Added:** A `Element.hasBox` predicate builder is now available. ([#1450](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1450))

## 0.64.0

### Minor Changes

- **Added:** Optional `Rectangle` property on `Element`. ([#1427](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1427))

  The new property can optionally be set when constructing an element, but it doesn't do anything yet.

- **Breaking:** The method `.elementDescendants()` on the classes `Document` and `Node` has been removed. In stead the function `Query.getElementDescendants()` should be used. ([#1425](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1425))

- **Added:** `Query` namespace with functions for querying element descendants and elements by id. ([#1413](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1413))

  The result of the queries are cached.

## 0.63.3

## 0.63.0

### Minor Changes

- **Breaking:** `hasUniqueId` is now directly a `Predicate` ([#1408](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1408))

  It used to a be `() => Predicate`, the useless void parameter has now been removed. To migrate, simply replace any call to `hasUniqueId()` by `hasUniqueId` (remove the useless empty parameter).

- **Added:** `hasTabIndex` now also accepts number values ([#1409](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1409))

  `hasTabIndex` accepts numbers and will be satisfied if the tabindex is any of these numbers. It still alternatively accepts a `Predicate<number>`.
