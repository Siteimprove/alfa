## 0.98.0

### Minor Changes

- **Added:** A new package for handling simple seedable RNGs. ([#1746](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/pull/1746))

  This creates simple Pseudo-RNGs that are not suited for cryptography or other high-security application.

  Such RNGs can be used for generating random tests or keys.
