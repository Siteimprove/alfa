/**
 * A factory for simple RNG. This creates a functorial factory where results can
 * be further mapped; once the #create() method is called the RNG is frozen and
 * cannot be mapped anymore; before it cannot be called.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The core of the RNG is taken from
 * {@link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/521295/seeding-the-random-number-generator-in-javascript}
 * {@link https://gist.github.com/tommyettinger/46a874533244883189143505d203312c}
 *
 * This is not a crypto-safe RNG. Use only for low-security needs.
 *
 * The RNG seed and iterations count can be inspected, this allows to reproduce
 * any sequence of random numbers by using the same seed and number of
 * iterations. This is notably intended to allow for deterministic debugging.
 *
 * Per nature of the goal we have here, the RNG class **dose not** respect
 * Alfa's Architecture Decision 6: Use pure functions, avoid hidden side effects.
 * {@link https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/blob/main/docs/architecture/decisions/adr-006.md}
 * The RNG has an internal state and works by side effect, it does not have referential transparency.
