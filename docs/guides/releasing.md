# Releasing

Due to the inter-dependencies with other repositories, and the need to use the new release in Siteimprove products deployment process, the full release flow is a bit complicated. For Alfa only, it is handled by [the release workflow](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/actions/workflows/release.yml), but check [How to release Alfa (Siteimprove internal document)](https://siteimprove-wgs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CE/pages/6291161101/How+to+release+Alfa) to be sure to not skip any step.
