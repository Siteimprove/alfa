# Contribution guidelines

> :warning: These contribution guidelines only apply to external contributors. Members of the Alfa development team are instead expected to follow the development process as outlined in the [process documentation](process.md).

Alfa accepts contributions in the form of bug reports submitted to the [issue tracker][] and feature suggestions submitted to the [discussion board][]. Prior to opening a new issue, please make sure to [search for existing issues][] that might already cover what you intended to report.

For legal reasons, Alfa only accepts code contributions from members of the [@siteimprove][] organization. We therefore ask that you do not submit pull requests unless you're a member of the Alfa development team or are otherwise affiliated with the [@siteimprove][] organization. Thank you!
