## Remarks

The painting order of flex children is different from the usual painting order, but we currently do not observe these differences. The assumption is that flex children, unless they are positioned or has z-index, should never overlap, so it's acceptable that we do not get their relative order right as long as the flex container itself is ordered correctly.
