|  [Node](./alfa-tree.node.md) | <p>Model for n-ary trees with some traversal flags.</p><p>In order to have a parent pointers, nodes are allowed to attach themselves to a parent node. To prevent mutation of an existing tree, the child is then "frozen".</p><p>Since it is not possible to add children after node creation, and it is not possible to re-attach an already attached node, this means that the trees are effectively downward frozen. In turn, this allows a bunch of optimisation since any traversal function that does not look upward can be cached.</p><p>The full tree (all nodes) must accept the same set of traversal flags, but the node type is not constrained.</p> |
