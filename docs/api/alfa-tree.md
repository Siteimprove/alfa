Model for n-ary trees with some traversal flags.

In order to have a parent pointers, nodes are allowed to attach themselves to a parent node. To prevent mutation of an existing tree, the child is then "frozen".

Since it is not possible to add children after node creation, and it is not possible to re-attach an already attached node, this means that the trees are effectively downward frozen. In turn, this allows a bunch of optimisation since any traversal function that does not look upward can be cached.

The full tree (all nodes) must accept the same set of traversal flags, but the node type is not constrained.
