## LengthPercentage.partiallyResolve() function

Partially resolves a length-percentage, when only a length resolver is provided.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export function partiallyResolve(resolver: PartialResolver): (value: LengthPercentage) => PartiallyResolved;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  resolver | [PartialResolver](./alfa-css.lengthpercentage.partialresolver.md) |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

(value: [LengthPercentage](./alfa-css.lengthpercentage.md)<!-- -->) =&gt; [PartiallyResolved](./alfa-css.lengthpercentage.partiallyresolved.md)

## Remarks

For many style properties, the percentages are resolved depending on the dimensions of the box, which we do not always have. In this case, we cannot resolve the percentage parts, but we can still fully resolve the length parts. Calculated percentages cannot be fully resolved into a canonical length, but we can nonetheless reduce them to a pure percentage. However, mixed calculations have to stay as they are.
