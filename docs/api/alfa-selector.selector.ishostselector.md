## Selector.isHostSelector variable

Whether a selector targets the shadow host of its tree (hence in another tree).

**Signature:**

```typescript
isHostSelector: Refinement<unknown, Host | HostContext, []>
```

## Remarks

\* `:host` and `:context` as part of a compound selector never match. \* `:host` and `:host-context` as the leftmost part of a complex selector actually match a node within the shadow tree. Thus, they are not considered as "host selector" and Complex.matches handles the case. \* `:host` and `:host-context` in other place of a complex selector do not match anything.
