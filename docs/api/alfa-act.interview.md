## Interview type

An Interview is either a direct ANSWER; or a question who is ultimately going to produce one, possibly through more questions (aka, an Interview).

The QUESTION type maps questions' URI to the expected type of answer, both as a JavaScript manipulable representation (T), and an actual type (A). The SUBJECT and CONTEXT types are the subject and context of the question.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Interview<QUESTION, SUBJECT, CONTEXT, ANSWER, D extends number = Interview.MaxDepth> = ANSWER | {
    [URI in keyof QUESTION]: Question<QUESTION[URI] extends [infer T, any] ? T : never, SUBJECT, CONTEXT, QUESTION[URI] extends [any, infer A] ? A : never, D extends -1 ? ANSWER : Interview<QUESTION, SUBJECT, CONTEXT, ANSWER, Depths[D]>, URI extends string ? URI : never>;
}[keyof QUESTION];
```
