|  [RuleTree](./alfa-cascade.ruletree.md) | <p>The rule tree is a data structure used for storing the rules that match each element when computing cascade for a document. Rules are stored in order from most to least specific; rules lower in the tree are therefore more specific than rules higher in the tree. Each element gets a pointer to the most specific rule it matched and can then follow pointers up the rule tree to locate decreasingly specific rules that the element also matches. This allows elements that share matched rules to also share a path in the rule tree.</p><p>As an example, consider elements A and B. Element A matches rules <code>div</code>, <code>.foo</code> and <code>.foo[href]</code> whereas element B matches rules <code>div</code>, <code>.foo</code> and <code>.bar</code>. The na√Øve approach to associating these matched rules with elements would be to associate an array of <code>[&quot;.foo[href]&quot;, &quot;.foo&quot;, &quot;div&quot;]</code> with element A and an array of <code>[&quot;.foo&quot;, &quot;div&quot;]</code> with element B. With the rule tree, we instead start by inserting the matched rules for element A into the tree:</p><p>"div" +-- ".foo" +-- ".foo\[href\]"</p><p>We then associate rule <code>&quot;.foo[href]&quot;</code> with element A and insert the matched rules for element B into the tree:</p><p>"div" +-- ".foo" +-- ".foo\[href\]" +-- ".bar"</p><p>We then associate the rule <code>&quot;.bar&quot;</code> with element B and we're done. Notice how the tree branches at rule <code>&quot;.foo&quot;</code>, allowing the two elements to share the path in the rule tree that they have in common. This approach is conceptually similar to associating arrays of matched rules with elements with the difference being that we use linked lists instead of arrays, allowing us to share parts of the list between elements. This allows for a much more memory efficient way of associating matched rules with elements, in particular for rules that match most elements, such as the universal selector or <code>html</code> and <code>body</code>.</p><p>[http://doc.servo.org/style/rule\_tree/struct.RuleTree.html](http://doc.servo.org/style/rule_tree/struct.RuleTree.html)</p> |
