## Cascade.get() method

Get the rule tree node associated with an element.

**Signature:**

```typescript
get(element: Element, context?: Context): RuleTree.Node;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  element | Element |  |
|  context | Context | _(Optional)_ |

**Returns:**

[RuleTree.Node](./alfa-cascade.ruletree.node.md)

## Remarks

This also adds the element to the rule tree if needed. That is, the rule tree is build lazily upon need. For the empty context, we pre-build the full tree, so we can benefit from an ancestor filter as we traverse the full DOM tree.

For other contexts, we assume that we will only need the style of a few elements (e.g., when a link is focused we normally only need the style of the link itself). Therefore, pre-building the full tree is not worth the cost.
