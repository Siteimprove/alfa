## Interview.conduct() function

Conduct an interview: \* if it is an answer, just send it back; \* if it is a rhetorical question, fetch its answer and recursively conduct an interview on it; \* if it is a true question, ask it to the oracle and recursively conduct an interview on the result.

Oracles must return Options, to have the possibility to not answer a given question (by returning None). Oracles must return Futures, because the full interview process is essentially async (e.g., asking through a CLI).

The final result of the interview is either a final answer (Left), or a diagnostic (Right) explaining why a final answer couldn't be found. Final answer will be turned into Passed/Failed outcomes, and diagnostic into Can't tell; the diagnostic is provided by the last unanswered question.

In both cases, we also record whether the oracle was actually used; this is useful to record the mode (auto/semi-auto) of the outcome.

function conduct<INPUT, TARGET extends Hashable, QUESTION extends Question.Metadata, SUBJECT, ANSWER>(interview: Interview<QUESTION, SUBJECT, TARGET, ANSWER>, rule: Rule<INPUT, TARGET, QUESTION, SUBJECT>, oracle: Oracle<INPUT, TARGET, QUESTION, SUBJECT>, oracleUsed?: boolean): Future<Either<Tuple<[ANSWER, boolean]>, Tuple<[Diagnostic, boolean]>>>;
```
