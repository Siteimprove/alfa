## Node\_2.\_frozen property

Whether the node is frozen.

**Signature:**

```typescript
protected _frozen: boolean;
```

## Remarks

As nodes are initialized without a parent and possibly attached to a parent after construction, this makes hierarchies of nodes mutable. That is, a node without a parent node may be assigned one by being passed as a child to a parent node. When this happens, a node becomes frozen. Nodes can also become frozen before being assigned a parent by using the `Node#freeze()` method.
