# Decisions

The following is an index of all the architecture decisions taken so far. Whenever a new architecture decision report is created, it must be added to the index regardless of its status. For guidance on how to write reports, please refer to the [architecture documentation](../README.md).

* [**ADR-001**](adr-001.md): Use architecture decision reports
* [**ADR-002**](adr-002.md): Move towards static analysis
* [**ADR-003**](adr-003.md): Use TypeScript as implementation language
