# Decisions

The following is an index of all the architecture decisions taken so far. Whenever a new architecture decision report is created, it must be added to the index regardless of its status. For guidance on how to write reports, please refer to the [architecture documentation](../architecture.md).

- [**ADR 1**](decisions/adr-001.md): Use architecture decision reports
- [**ADR 2**](decisions/adr-002.md): Move towards static analysis
- [**ADR 3**](decisions/adr-003.md): Use TypeScript as implementation language
- [**ADR 4**](decisions/adr-004.md): Model browser specific values and computations
- [**ADR 5**](decisions/adr-005.md): Don't depend on third party code to produce results
- [**ADR 6**](decisions/adr-006.md): Use pure functions, avoid hidden side effects
- [**ADR 7**](decisions/adr-007.md): Export/import full namespace, not individual functions
- [**ADR 8**](decisions/adr-008.md): Use `Option<T>` to model optional values
- [**ADR 9**](decisions/adr-009.md): Use `Result<T, E>` to model errors
- [**ADR 10**](decisions/adr-010.md): Use `Future<T>` to model possibly asynchronous computations
- [**ADR 11**](decisions/adr-011.md): Use serializable trees with parent pointers, and downward immutability
- [**ADR 12**](decisions/adr-012.md): Use side-effect free (monadic) questions
- [**ADR 13**](decisions/adr-013.md): Use trilean logic for reasoning about possibly unknown results
