# Decisions

The following is an index of all the architecture decisions taken so far. Whenever a new architecture decision report is created, it must be added to the index regardless of its status. For guidance on how to write reports, please refer to the [architecture documentation](../architecture.md).

- [**ADR 1**](decisions/adr-001.md): Use architecture decision reports
- [**ADR 2**](decisions/adr-002.md): Move towards static analysis
- [**ADR 3**](decisions/adr-003.md): Use TypeScript as implementation language
- [**ADR 4**](decisions/adr-004.md): Model browser specific values and computations
- [**ADR 5**](decisions/adr-005.md): Don't depend on third party code to produce results
