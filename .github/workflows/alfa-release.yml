name: Create a new release (generic workflow)

# This workflow creates and publish a new release of an Alfa repo.
#
# This workflow is intended to work on Alfa repos sharing the same structure for code and release.
# Namely:
# * TypeScript (or ECMAScript) mono-repo, with yarn workspaces in `packages/alfa-*`
# * Default branch on `main`
# * Relying on the `yarn install` / `yarn build` / `yarn test` cycle.
# * Using node_modules for dependencies resolution.
# * Using changeset for storing local changes as they happen.
# * Sharing version number between all packages (`fixed` in changeset config).
# * One CHANGELOG.md per workspace (this is part of changeset)
# * One top-level CHANGELOG.md (currently with links to the individual ones, but this is something we
#   may want to improve as part of this workflow).
# * Packages published on the Github registry (may be public or restricted).
#
# This workflow is likely to fail on any repository that does not have the same structure.
# Use at your own judgement call.
