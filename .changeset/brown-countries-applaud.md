**Breaking:** New abstractions for calculatable numeric values (numbers, percentages, dimensions) are introduced and used in style properties. Currently, style properties only accept non-calculated numeric (except for some properties that already accepted calculated lengths or length-percentages and keep doing so).

These abstractions are now exported from `@siteimprove/alfa-css` instead of the old abstractions which didn't accept calculations. In order to keep the functionalities of the old abstractions, replace `Foo` (`Number`, `Length`, â€¦) with `Foo.Fixed`.

The new abstractions come with a `#resolve()` method which resolve any remaining calculation and returns a `Fixed` value. These methods need various resolvers argument depending on the precise abstraction (e.g. `Length#resolve` needs to know how to resolve relative lengths into `px`).
