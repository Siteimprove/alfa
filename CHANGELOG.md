# Changelog

All notable changes to Alfa will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and Alfa adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<details>
<summary><strong>Guidelines for writing changelog entries</strong></summary>

The changelog includes a single entry for every released version of Alfa. Each entry is identified by two pieces of information: The version number and the date, in [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format, of the release. The very first entry in the changelog, labelled `[Unreleased]`, includes all upcoming changes for inclusion in the next release.

Each entry may begin with an general description of the changes introduced in the release and must then list each notable change as separate list items. For each item, the following should be included:

- The name of the package affected, as the first point in the item: `[@siteimprove/alfa-<package>](packages/alfa-<package>): <description>`. If more than one package is affected, the package names must be separated by a comma.

- The issue and/or pull request that concerns the change, as the last point in the item and enclosed by parentheses: `<description> ([#<number>](../../issues/<number>))`. If more than one reference is needed, the references must be separated by a comma. All references must be within the same set of parentheses.

Items that are related, such as breaking changes, new features, or changes to existing features, should be grouped under an appropriate heading.

**Note on links:** For all links to repository resources rooted at `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`, make sure to use paths relative to `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob` which is the path from which GitHub [performs autolinking](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files). This helps keeps links short and ensures that they are not tied to a specific owner and repository name in the event that we should move and/or rename the repository.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- [@siteimprove/alfa-style](packages/alfa-style): Styles set via the `style` attribute are now correctly applied.

### Breaking

- [@siteimprove/alfa-scraper](packages/alfa-scraper), [@siteimprove/alfa-cli](packages/alfa-cli): The `Scraper` class has received a much-needed overhaul which has resulted in a couple of breaking changes. The changes also carry over to the CLI; for more information, please see the associated pull requests. ([#226](../../pull/226), [#235](../../pull/235))

- [@siteimprove/alfa-dom](packages/alfa-dom): The `Sheet.JSON` interface now requires a `condition` property. ([#220](../../pull/220))

### Added

- [@siteimprove/alfa-dom](packages/alfa-dom): The `Sheet` class now includes information about media conditions, which can be added to style sheets through `<link rel="stylesheet" media="condition">`. ([#220](../../pull/220))

- [@siteimprove/alfa-rules](packages/alfa-rules): Implementations of SIA-R69 and SIA-R82 are now available. ([#228](../../pull/228), [#231](../../pull/231))

- [@siteimprove/alfa-selector](packages/alfa-selector): Support for the pseudo-classes `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`, and `:root` in addition to the pseudo-elements `::before` and `::after` has been added. ([#238](../../pull/238))

### Changed

- [@siteimprove/alfa-rules](packages/alfa/rules): For rules that deal with `<video>` and `<audio>` elements, the `is-streaming` question has been split into `is-video-streaming` and `is-audio-streaming` to better facilitate messaging. ([#181](../../pull/181))

### Fixed

- [@siteimprove/alfa-cascade](packages/alfa-cascade): Style sheet media conditions are now considered when computing cascade and disabled style sheets are no longer included. ([#220](../../pull/220))

- [@siteimprove/alfa-rules](packages/alfa-rules): SIA-R45 now fails table cells that reference themselves in the `headers` attribute. ([#224](../../pull/224))

- [@siteimprove/alfa-css](packages/alfa-css): Property declarations that specify the `!important` flag are now correctly parsed. ([#233](../../pull/233))

## [0.0.1](../../compare/v0.0.0...v0.0.1) (2020-04-27)

### Changed

- [@siteimprove/alfa-rules](packages/alfa-rules): SIA-R21 now applies to elements with explicit _and_ implicit semantic roles, but no longer applies to elements with `role` values that consist solely of ASCII whitespace. ([#218](../../pull/218))

## [0.0.0](../../releases/tag/v0.0.0) (2020-04-22)

This is the first public of release of Alfa, available for download through [GitHub Packages](../../packages). This release is focused on providing a solid foundation of tools for people and organisations to start testing within their own workflows. Do be aware that as we are still not at a level of API stability where we feel confident in providing compatibility guarantees for future releases, this release, and the ones that follow it throughout this initial version 0, will not be considered stable.

For instructions on how to get up and running with Alfa, be sure to check out the ["Usage" section](../../#usage) of the README.
